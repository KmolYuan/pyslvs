    Normalize the Elliptical Fourier Descriptor coefficients for a polygon.

    Implements Kuhl and Giardina method of normalizing the coefficients
    An, Bn, Cn, Dn. Performs 3 separate normalizations. First, it makes the

    Secondly, the data is rotated with respect to the major axis. Thirdly,
    the coefficients are normalized with regard to the absolute value of A_1.
